# Automation Cloud Client Testing
An expansion of the [‘Automation-Cloud-Live-Search-Demo’](https://github.com/crozuk/Automation-Cloud-Live-Search-Demo) project.

Learning to use the Automation Cloud client package to interact with an existing service - writing async client functions to replace previous basic HTTP requests (fetch).

App will run example job with two predefined input values. No error handling is currently in place.

Also testing creating custom API endpoints to interact with the defined client functions with a view to accepting inputs and responding with outputs.
